International
================================

This project, being very language-related, was born with the focus in the spanish-hate.
However, you can create your own version of the project on any language.
An italian version (a bit outdate today) is here: https://github.com/botpartigiano/odiometro

Please feel free to contact us at https://twitter.com/odiometrobot if you're planning to create an international bot.
The docs are in spanish right now but I don't have any problem in translating them to English if that helps you create your own version.
